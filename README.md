# Experiments in Probability with Python

Learning probability with Python

---

To get started, make sure Python is (installed)[https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/] locally. Do this by opening Terminal and installing `HomeBrew`, then installing `Python`:
```
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
$ brew install python
```
To run python, enter the directory where your file is and execute it with `python3`. For example:
```
$ cd Documents/GitHub/Experiments-in-Probability/
$ python3 coinflip.py
```

# Running the Experiments

### Coinflip.py

This is a straightforward coin-flipping simulation. Press enter to flip the coin, type `x` and then press enter to stop and count up the results.
